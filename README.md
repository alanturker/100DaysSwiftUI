# 100 Days of SwiftUI

A personal journey to master SwiftUI through building practical iOS applications. This project started on September 22nd and continues with daily app development to gain deeper understanding of SwiftUI framework.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of iOS applications built with SwiftUI, each designed to explore different aspects of the framework and improve overall iOS development skills.

## Completed Projects

| Day | Project | Description | Status |
|-----|---------|-------------|--------|
| Day 1 | WeSplit | Bill splitting and tip calculation app | Done |
| Day 1 | WeConverse | Unit conversion application | Done |
| Day 2 | WeGuessTheFlag | Interactive flag guessing game | Done |
| Day 3 | - | ViewModifier and View Composition practice | - |
| Day 4 | WeRockPaperScissors | Rock Paper Scissors game with enum | Done |

## Learning Goals

- Master SwiftUI fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Build real-world applications with practical use cases
- Understand iOS app architecture and design patterns
- Improve problem-solving skills through hands-on coding
- Develop a portfolio of diverse iOS applications

## Project Structure

Each project is organized as a separate Xcode project with:
- Main app file (`AppNameApp.swift`)
- Content view (`ContentView.swift`)
- Assets and resources
- Proper project configuration

## Future Plans

This journey will continue with more complex applications covering:
- Data persistence and Core Data
- Networking and API integration
- Advanced animations and transitions
- Custom views and components
- App Store deployment

## Getting Started

Each project can be opened and run independently in Xcode. Simply open the `.xcodeproj` file for any project you want to explore or run.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **Xcode** - iOS development environment
- **Swift** - Programming language
