# 100 Days of SwiftUI

A personal journey to master SwiftUI through building practical iOS applications. This project started on September 18th and continues with daily app development to gain deeper understanding of SwiftUI framework.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of iOS applications built with SwiftUI, each designed to explore different aspects of the framework and improve overall iOS development skills.

## Learning Goals

- Master SwiftUI fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Build real-world applications with practical use cases
- Understand iOS app architecture and design patterns
- Improve problem-solving skills through hands-on coding
- Develop a portfolio of diverse iOS applications

## Project Structure

Each project is organized as a separate Xcode project with:
- Main app file (`AppNameApp.swift`)
- Content view (`ContentView.swift`)
- Assets and resources
- Proper project configuration

## Upcoming Topics

As I approach the final stretch of the 100 Days challenge, upcoming topics include:
- Advanced SwiftUI architecture patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Testing and debugging strategies
- Final capstone projects
- Portfolio app refinement
- App Store deployment preparation

## Getting Started

Each project can be opened and run independently in Xcode. Simply open the `.xcodeproj` file for any project you want to explore or run.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **Swift** - Programming language
- **Xcode** - iOS development environment
- **SwiftData** - Data persistence framework
- **Core ML** - Machine learning integration
- **MapKit** - Location and map services
- **Core Image** - Image processing and filters
- **URLSession** - Networking and API calls
- **PhotosPicker** - Photo selection
- **Biometric Authentication** - Face ID / Touch ID

## Key Concepts Learned

- State management (@State, @Binding, @Observable)
- Navigation patterns and deep linking
- Data persistence (UserDefaults, SwiftData)
- Networking and JSON decoding
- Animations and transitions
- Accessibility features
- Core Image filters
- MapKit integration
- Machine learning with Core ML
- Form validation
- Gesture recognizers
