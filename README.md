## Learning Goals

- Master SwiftUI fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Build real-world applications with practical use cases
- Understand iOS app architecture and design patterns
- Improve problem-solving skills through hands-on coding
- Develop a portfolio of diverse iOS applications

## Project Structure

Each project is organized as a separate Xcode project with:
- Main app file (`AppNameApp.swift`)
- Content view (`ContentView.swift`)
- Assets and resources
- Proper project configuration

## Challenge Completed! 🎉

After 100 days of consistent learning and building, this challenge has been successfully completed! The journey covered:
- ✅ 25+ practical iOS applications built from scratch
- ✅ Mastered SwiftUI fundamentals and advanced techniques
- ✅ Implemented real-world features like networking, data persistence, and maps
- ✅ Learned accessibility, animations, gestures, and Core Image
- ✅ Built milestone and capstone projects showcasing all skills

## What's Next

- Continue building advanced SwiftUI applications
- Refine and polish existing projects for portfolio
- Explore App Store deployment
- Contribute to open-source SwiftUI projects
- Stay updated with latest SwiftUI features

## Getting Started

Each project can be opened and run independently in Xcode. Simply open the `.xcodeproj` file for any project you want to explore or run.
